### Work
I do tech support for [Titan](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/titan/), one of the fastest scientific research computers in the world. It's pretty rad.

I also helped build a toy supercomputer to teach kids how they work. [Tiny Titan](https://github.com/Tinytitan) was [featured in Popular Science](http://www.popsci.com/article/diy/supersize-your-diy-computing-tiny-titan) in September 2014. Bill Nye was on the [cover](http://www.popsci.com/article/science/now-live-september-2014-issue-popular-science-magazine), no big deal. It is also on display at the [AMSE](http://amse.org/) science museum.

### Research
I study [new algorithms](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11075-012-9562-1) to solve differential equations with [Samuel Jator](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Samuel_Jator). Differential equations pop up all over science, and some are harder to solve than others. We focus on the hard ones.

### Volunteer Stuff
Sometimes I volunteer with Planned Parenthood in Knoxville. I think it's important that Tennessee becomes a better place for reproductive health.
