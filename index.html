        <h3>About Me</h3>

<p>I am a software engineer, mathematician, researcher, and aspiring math educator. I believe that improving and spreading math literacy is an important goal, and that mathematics is vital to understanding the complex social, economic, and environmental issues of the 21st century. I also believe that quality software can be a tremendous tool for helping educators achieve this goal.</p>

<h3>Open Source</h3>

<p>I believe in the power of open source software. The free sharing of technology can help people solve problems both for themselves and one another. I expect freely available, quality software will be behind many advances in scientific computing and educational technology over the next several years.</p>

<h3>Experience</h3>

<p>I have been developing web applications professionally for almost 10 years. I am a fan of REST and other paradigms for interconnecting web services, as I believe that they help foster interconnectivity, and importantly they allow for web applications to support many client front ends, such as specialized accessible front-ends for differently abled persons. The old style of all-in-one web applications that generate HTML as request responses neither scale well nor lend themselves to addressing such usability issues.</p>

<h3>Scientific Research</h3>

<p>My scientific research focuses on Genetic Algorithms, Finite Element Analysis, and Numerov-style ODE solvers. My paper with Dr. Samuel Jator and Scott Swindell introducing a "Trigonometrically fitted block Numerov type method" was recently published in the journal <i>Numerical Algorithms</i> and is available online <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/e674516w43821148/">here</a>. In the future I hope to begin studying teaching techniques in elementary math education, and the impacts of poverty on mathematical achievement and literacy.</p>
