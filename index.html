<h3>Experience</h3>

<p>I have been developing web applications professionally for almost 10 years. I am a fan of REST and other paradigms for interconnecting web services, as I believe that they help foster good architecture, improve scalability, and most importantly they allow for applications to support multiple client front-ends, such as specialized accessible front-ends for differently abled persons.</p>

<p>I believe in the importance of Agile development, particularly with respect to testing and user feedback as a way to help guarantee software quality. <i>I love working with customers</i>. You can find a copy of my resume <b><a href="images/RobertDFrench--Resume.pdf">here</a></b>.</p>

<h3><i>Mathematica</i> Book</h3>

<p>Together with my advisor, Dr. Samuel Jator, I am writing <b><a href="https://github.com/robertdfrench/MathematicaBook/blob/master/MathematicaForUndergraduateResearch.pdf?raw=true">An Introduction to <i>Mathematica</i> Programming for Undergraduate Research</a></b>. The goal of the book is to help undergraduate science students develop the functional and symbolic programming skills needed to excel in computational research.</p>

<h3>Scientific Research</h3>

<p>My scientific research focuses on Genetic Algorithms, Finite Element Analysis, Numerov-style ODE Solvers, and Backward Differentation Formulae. My paper with Dr. Samuel Jator and Scott Swindell introducing a <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/e674516w43821148/">Trigonometrically fitted block Numerov type method</a> was recently published in the journal, <i>Numerical Algorithms</i>.</p>

<p>In 2011, my research with Casey McKnight (Stanford) and Amber O'Connell (OSU) on a massively parallel implementation of the Finite Element Method was presented in the Numerical Analysis section of the AMS-MAA Joint Mathematics Meeting in New Orleans, LA. The <a href="https://github.com/mcknightcasey/Bamboo">Bamboo</a> software improves the performance of the classical FEM by distributing construction of the Stiffness Matrix across a cluster of <i>Mathematica</i> nodes.</p>

<h3>Math Education Projects</h3>

<p>I believe that improving and spreading math literacy is an important goal, and that mathematics is vital to understanding the complex social, economic, and environmental issues of the 21st century. I also believe that quality software can be a tremendous tool for helping educators achieve this goal. To that end, I am collaborating with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/justinlauria">Justin Lauria</a> (Zynga), <a href="http://www.calebwherry.com/">J. Caleb Wherry</a> (VA Tech), and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/liza-kurtz/5b/73/866">Liza C. Kurtz</a> (APSU) to develop an adaptive, collaborative web-based math workbook targeted at 5th-9th grade students. The <a href="http://github.com/robertdfrench/MathAcademy">Math Academy</a> software works by traversing a skill dependency graph to determine where students most need help.</p>

<p>In the future I hope to begin researching new teaching techniques in elementary math education, algorithms for adaptive web-based math education tools, and the impacts of poverty on mathematical achievement and literacy.</p>
